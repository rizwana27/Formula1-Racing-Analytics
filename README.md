Implemented Azure Data Factory for ETL workflows, integrating raw race data from external sources into Azure Data Lake Storage. Utilized Azure Databricks for scalable data transformation, feature engineering, and predictive analytics on race performance. Deployed a real-time streaming pipeline using Azure Stream Analytics and Event Hubs to capture live race data. Designed a serverless architecture using Azure Functions for event-driven processing. Built interactive dashboards in Power BI integrated with Azure Synapse Analytics for driver performance insights, lap times, and race strategy insights. Improved the data pipelines and storage with Azure Blob Storage and Cosmos DB with low-latency access and efficient querying.
